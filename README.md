## gedit-logcat-highlight

Seeing logcat in Eclipse/Android Studio is beautiful, but txt file is not.
Highlight your logcat in gedit!

[Ubuntu]
1. Put logcat.lang under /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/
2. Set "logcat" Highlight Mode in gedit.
3. Or you can save your log file with a ".logcat" extension, it will automatically highlight when open in gedit.
